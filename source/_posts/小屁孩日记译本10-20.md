## 第十一页

My family was living in a really small apartment back then,and I had to share a room with Rodrick. He got the crib,so for the first few months of my life I had to sleep in the top dresser drawer,which I'm pretty sure isn't even legal.

那时候我们家住在一个特别小的公寓里，我和Rodrick共用一个房间，他住在婴儿床里，而我在生命中的最初几个月里不得不睡在梳妆台上，我很确定这是不合法的。

Eventually,Dad moved his work stuff out of the room he was using as an office and made it into a nursery.I got Rodrick's old crib,and he got a new bad.

最终，爸爸把他的办公用品从他原来用来办公的房间里挪了出来，然后把房间打造成了婴儿房。我得到了Rodrick的旧婴儿床，他得到了一张新床。

Almost EVERYTHING I had back in those days was a hand-me-down from Rodrick.

那时候我的几乎所有东西都是从Rodrick那得到的。

## 第十二页

By the something came to me,it was either worn-out or covered in slobber.

我突然想到了什么，那些东西要么破烂不堪，要么沾满口水。

Even my DUMMY was a hand-me-down from Rodrick. I don't think he was ready to give it up, though, which might explin why he's never really liked me.

连我的奶嘴都是Rodrick用过的。我认为他从来没打算放弃它们，这也许就是他从来都不喜欢我的原因。

## 第十三页

It was just the four of us for a long time, and then one day Mom told me she was gonna have another baby. I was glad she gave me the heads-up so I could be ready.

在很长的时间里家里都只有我们四个人，直到有一天，妈妈告诉我她又要生孩子了，我很高兴她能提前告诉我让我提前有所准备。

When my little brother, Manny, came along, everybody thought he was so cute. But what they don't tell you about babies is that after they're born they have this black stub on their belly button where the umbilical cord was tied off.

当我的小兄弟Manny到来，所有人都认为他很可爱。但是没有人告诉你，婴儿出生之后肚脐上会挂一个黑色的脐带。

## 第十四页

Eventually, the stub dries up and falls off, and the baby has a regular-looking belly button, the thing is nobody ever FOUND Manny's stub. And to this day I'm still paranid it's gonna show up somewhere.

最终那个肉球脱水后脱落了，露出了一个相貌平平的肚脐眼，但有个问题是，没有任何人见过这个小肉球。
