## 第六页

I mean,I was INSIDE her, so I could hear every word she said whether I wanted to or not.

我的意思是，我在她肚子里，所以我可以听到她说的所有字，不管我想不想听。

I could also hear just about EVERYTHING that was happening on the outside. So when Mom and Dad got all mushy I had to listen to THAT, too.

我还可以听到外边发生的一切事情。所以当妈妈和爸爸情意缠绵的时候，我依然可以听到。

## 第七页

I've never really felt comfortable when people are acting affectionate around me, ESPECIALLY when it's my parents. I tried to get them to stop, but they never got the message.

当有人在我周围情意缠绵的时候，我感觉非常不舒服，特别是当那个人是我的父母的时候。我尝试让他们停下来，但是他们从未收到过这个信号。

In fact, everything I tried just seemed to make things WORSE.

事实上，我做到一切尝试都只会让事情变得更糟。
