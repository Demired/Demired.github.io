小屁孩日记

## 第一页

JANUARY

Sunday

I wish I'd started keeping a journal a lot earlier on,because whoever ends up writing my biography is gonna have a lot of questions about my life in the years leading up to middle school.

一月的第一个星期日

我希望我得尽早开始写日记，因为不管到最后谁来写我的人物传记，都会有很多关于我中学时候的问题要问。

Luckily, I remember just about everyting That's happened to me since I was born.In face,I can even remember stuff that happened to me Before I was born.

幸运的是，我几乎记得从我出生以来发生的所有事。事实上，我现在依然记得很多我出生之后发生的事。

Back in those days it was just me swimming around in the dark,doing backflips and taking naps whenever I wanted

从某天开始我只是在黑暗中笼罩的地方游泳，翻滚，睡觉，做任何我想做的事。

## 第二页

Then one day,when I was in the middle of a really good nap,I got woken up by these strange noises coming from the outside.

指导有一天，当我还在做一个非常甜美的梦的时候，我被外边巨大的响声吵醒了。

At the time I didn't know what the heck I was hearing,but later on I found out it was Mom piping in music through these speakers she put on her belly.

当时我还不知道我听到的什么鬼东西，但是很快我就发现那是我妈妈把喇叭贴在读自杀过给我放音乐。

I guess Mom thought if she played classical music for me every day before I was born it would turn me into some kind of genius.

我猜我妈妈认为，如果她每天给我播放一些古典音乐，在我出生之后我就会成为某种天才。

## 第三页

Those speakers came with a microphone,and when Mom wasn't playing music she was telling me everything that was going on in her life.

这个喇叭连接了一个麦克风，当妈妈不播放音乐的时候她就会通过麦克告诉我她生活中发生的一切。

And when Dad came home from work Mom would have him give me a blow-by-blow of His day.

当爸爸从公司回到家，妈妈就让他给我讲他的一天。

## 第四页

But that wasn't the end of it.Every night,Mom would read to me for a half hour before she went to bed.

但是这还没完。每天晚上妈妈们睡觉前妈妈还要给我读半个小时书。

The problem was my sleep schedule didn't line up with Mom's.So when she was sleeping I'd be wide awake.

问题是我的睡眠时间和妈妈的时间线并不重合。所以当她要睡觉的时候，我还非常兴奋。

I actually wish I'd paid more attention when Mom was reading to me,though.

尽管这样，我依然希望，在妈妈为我读书时候我能多付出点精力。

## 第五页

Last week in school we had a pop quiz on a book,and I hadn't read it yet.I was pretty sure Mon read that one to me before I was born,but I couldn't remember any of the details.

上周在学校，我们有一本书的随堂测验，但是我没读过它。我相当确认妈妈在我出生之前给我读过那本书，但是我记不起任何关于那本书的内容。

I guess the week Mom was reading that book I was busy doing something else.

我猜在当我妈妈读那本书的那周里，我在忙着做别的事。

The crazy thing was Mom didn't need to use the mircophone for me to hear her.

愚蠢的是，妈妈根本不需要使用麦克风就可以让我听到她的声音。
